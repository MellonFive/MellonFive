# Hello guys, nice to meet you! :D

<p>My name is Felipe Castelli Mellão and I'm 29 years old.</p>

<p>I live with my parents in Brazil, São Paulo, Guarulhos.</p>

<p>I have a dream of being a specialist Front End programmer, working and living in England in Liverpool.</p>

<p>I started to become interested in programming at the university of guarulhos at the age of 20 when I entered the computer science course in 2012.</p>

<p>However, due to personal problems, I had to start again at the age of 23 at UNIBTA and I graduated in analysis and systems development.</p>

<p>Since then I have been struggling to get my first job as a Front-End programmer.</p>

<p>At home I study at collabcode which was a community made by Professor Marco Bruno to do Front-End projects.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to go to programming events, I like watching technology news, watching cooking videos, yes, I love to cook too.</p>

<p>I also love video games. I want to create a lot of games, both for the web and for consoles. I like to watch videos on the internet about personal, professional transformation and psychology.</p>

<p>Philosophizing about life is also a habit that I put into practice during programming.</p>

<p>Obtain knowledge and practice always.</p>

<p>Never forget, we can always learn from each other.</p>

## Would you like to find me?
