# Hello guys, nice to meet you! :D

My name is Felipe Castelli Mellão, I'm 28 years old. I live with my parents in Brazil, São Paulo, Guarulhos. I have a dream of being a specialist programmer Front End, working and living in England in liverpool. I started programming in college in university of guarulhos at the age of 20. However, due to personal problems, I had to start again at the age of 23. Since then, I have been struggling to get my first job as a Front-end programmer. Never forget, we can always learn from each other. 

In my spare time I like to watch tech news and watch cooking videos, yes I love to cook too. I also love video games and I want to create a lot of games, both for the web and for consoles. I like to watch video on the internet about personal and professional transformation and psychology. Philosophizing about life is also a habit that I put into practice while programming.

Would you like to find me?
