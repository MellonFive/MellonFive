# Hello guys, nice to meet you! :D

My name is Felipe Castelli Mellão and I'm 28 years old.

I live with my parents in Brazil, São Paulo, Guarulhos.

I have a dream of being a specialist Front End programmer, working and living in England in Liverpool.

I started to become interested in programming at the university of guarulhos at the age of 20 when I entered the computer science course in 2012.

However, due to personal problems, I had to start again at the age of 24 at UNIBTA and I graduated in analysis and systems development.

Since then I have been struggling to get my first job as a Front-End programmer.

At home I study at collabcode which was a community made by Professor Marco Bruno to do Front-End projects.

In my free time I like to go to programming events, I like watching technology news, watching cooking videos, yes, I love to cook too.

I also love video games. I want to create a lot of games, both for the web and for consoles. I like to watch videos on the internet about personal, professional transformation and psychology.

Philosophizing about life is also a habit that I put into practice during programming.

Obtain knowledge and practice always.

Never forget, we can always learn from each other.
